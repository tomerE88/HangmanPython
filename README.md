This Hangman project encapsulates a classic word guessing game implemented in Python,
featuring ASCII art for visual representation of the hangman, the game state, winning, and losing.
The game begins by greeting players with a stylized welcome message and continues
by prompting them to guess letters to uncover a secret word chosen from a file.
Players have a maximum of six attempts to guess wrong letters, with each incorrect guess adding a part to the hangman's drawing,
visually represented through a series of ASCII drawings stored in a dictionary.
Key functions manage the gameplay dynamics, including validating guesses to ensure they are single,
alphabetic characters not previously guessed, updating the list of guessed letters, and revealing parts of the secret word as letters are correctly guessed.
The program is structured to clear the terminal screen after each guess to keep the interface clean and to focus the player on the current state of the game.
If the player successfully guesses the word within the allowed attempts, they are greeted with a winning message,
otherwise, a losing message displays alongside the correct word.
his educational tool not only entertains but also helps to enhance programming and problem-solving skills through interactive and engaging gameplay.
